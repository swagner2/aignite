Below is the best-in-class Welcome Series blueprint specifically for a SUPPLEMENTS brand—based on what consistently performs for Ritual, Athletic Greens, Bloom, Cymbiotika, Seed, Hims/Hers, BetterBrand, Care/of, Legion, Obvi, and Olly.

Supplements have different psychological triggers than snacks or beverages:
	•	Customers need proof before putting something in their body
	•	They worry about effectiveness, safety, ingredients, dosage, and side effects
	•	They want validation from experts, customers, and research
	•	Education is EVERYTHING
	•	User Generated Content is necessary but science + clarity converts the best
	•	The journey → not just the product → must feel supportive

This welcome series blueprint is engineered to maximize first purchase, subscription enrollments, and long-term retention.
