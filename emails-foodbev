Best-in-Class Components of a Welcome Series (Food & Beverage Edition)

Food & beverage is different from apparel, supplements, or beauty because:
	•	Taste = the #1 buying decision
	•	People want fast reassurance before trying something edible
	•	Discovery, flavor exploration, and social proof drive conversions
	•	Brand values matter more (clean ingredients, functional benefits, sustainability)
	•	UGC is extremely influential

So this welcome series is engineered to maximize first purchase, repeat purchase, and long-term brand loyalty.
