Below is an enhanced and fully updated version of your Abandoned Cart Framework that includes segmentation logic, messaging rules, and incentive structure for:

1️⃣ New visitors with cart value BELOW the store’s AOV goal

→ Encourage adding more to cart, reinforce value, OR guide them back to the Welcome Series incentive.

2️⃣ New visitors with cart value ABOVE the store’s AOV goal

→ Push fast checkout, emphasize urgency, and avoid unnecessary discounts (protect margin).

This is now a best-in-class, segmented abandon cart flow optimized for revenue, AOV growth, and better margin efficiency.

🚦 SEGMENT 2: NEW VISITORS – CART VALUE ABOVE AOV GOAL

Primary Objective:

✔ Protect margins
✔ Push urgency + speed
✔ Don’t offer additional discounts
✔ Reinforce value, trust, and convenience

💡 WHY THIS SEGMENTATION STRATEGY WORKS

For Low AOV New Visitors

✔ They need help building a cart worth buying.
✔ Incentives RECAPTURE them and move them toward AOV goals.
✔ Bundles & “complete the look” suggestions naturally lift AOV.

For High AOV New Visitors

✔ They already behave like high-value customers → avoid discounting.
✔ They need friction removal → trust, speed, reassurance.
✔ Protect margin while increasing conversion rate.
