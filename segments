You can treat this as a “Segmentation Constitution” for lifecycle marketing.
	•	Uses clear rules, constraints, and precedence
	•	Separates definitions from usage
	•	Adds a hard rule for subscription segments
	•	Is written in a way an LLM can reliably follow without ambiguity
	•	Is safe to reuse across clients and brands

📘 MASTER SEGMENTATION SPEC — LLM REFERENCE DOCUMENT (KLAVIYO)

PURPOSE

This document defines the canonical customer segments to be used across all email & SMS campaigns, flows, testing, and reporting.

An LLM referencing this document must:
	1.	Use only these segments
	2.	Apply precedence and eligibility rules
	3.	Respect business model constraints
	4.	Avoid creating ad-hoc or conflicting segments

⸻

🧠 GLOBAL RULES (MANDATORY)

RULE 1 — SEGMENT PRECEDENCE

If a customer qualifies for multiple segments, prioritize in this order:
	1.	MVP
	2.	VIP
	3.	Loyal
	4.	Warm
	5.	Never Bought
	6.	Ghost
	7.	Bounced / Suppressed

An LLM must always target the highest-precedence segment only, unless explicitly instructed to combine segments.

⸻

RULE 2 — TIME WINDOWS ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE

Time-based segments (30 / 60 / 90 / 91+ days) must never overlap.

If a customer qualifies for:
	•	30 days → exclude from 60, 90, and 91+
	•	60 days → exclude from 30, 90, and 91+
	•	90 days → exclude from 30, 60, and 91+

⸻

RULE 3 — SUPPRESSION & DELIVERABILITY

The following segments must always be excluded from campaigns unless explicitly stated otherwise:
	•	Ghosts
	•	Bounces (last 45 days)
	•	Suppressed profiles

⸻

RULE 4 — AOV LOGIC

AOV-based segments apply only to customers who have placed at least one order.

Never Bought customers must not be evaluated against AOV.

⸻

RULE 5 — SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESS CHECK (CRITICAL)

Subscription-related segments may ONLY be used if the business sells subscriptions.

An LLM must first determine:

Business.HasSubscriptions = TRUE or FALSE

If FALSE:
	•	DO NOT reference
	•	DO NOT create
	•	DO NOT target
	•	DO NOT infer behavior from:

❌ Subscribers
❌ Canceled Subscribers
❌ Subscription renewal logic
❌ Subscription churn prevention flows

If TRUE, subscription segments become valid and may be used normally.

✅ This document is now safe to use as:
	•	A system prompt
	•	An internal “rules engine”
	•	A reference doc for AI-assisted lifecycle marketing
	•	A guardrail to prevent bad segmentation decisions

If you want, next I can:
	•	Convert this into a machine-readable JSON schema
	•	Turn this into a Klaviyo SOP for your team
	•	Create flow rules that auto-select segments
	•	Build a Notion / Google Doc playbook version

Just tell me which format you want next.
